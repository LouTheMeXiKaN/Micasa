* **Content (from top to bottom):** 
* **Smart Link Notification Banner** (conditional, at very top): Dynamic navigation based on pending item type:

 * Tapping "View all ‚Üí" navigates to **Screen 12: "My Events" Hub (Upcoming tab)**

### **Screen 5: Event Creation (Step 1 - The "What & Where")**

* **Purpose**: To capture the essential, public-facing details of a new event in a clean and intuitive interface.  
* **Content**: A single-screen form containing the following fields:  
  * Cover Image: An image upload control, initially showing a placeholder icon. Tapping it should open the phone's native image library for the user to select a photo.  
  * Event Title: A mandatory text input field.  
  * Event Description: A multi-line text area allowing for a more detailed description of the event.  
  * Start Time: A mandatory control that opens the phone's native date/time picker UI.  
  * End Time: A mandatory control that also opens the native date/time picker UI.  
  * Location: A simple, single-line text input field for the location name or address (e.g., "Prospect Park Boathouse" or "123 Main St, Brooklyn, NY").  
* **Action**: A primary [Next] button is located at the bottom of the screen.  
  * Logic: The `[Next]` button is disabled until all mandatory fields (Title, Start Time, End Time) are filled out.  
  * Navigation: Once tapped, the app validates the inputs and navigates the user to `Screen 6: Event Creation (Step 2 - The "Rules & How")`.

### **Screen 6: Event Creation (Step 2 - The "Rules & How")**

* **Purpose:** To configure the rules for privacy, pricing, and attendance for a new event.  
* **Content:** A series of interactive controls:  
  * **Location Visibility:** A set of radio buttons:  
    * Show address immediately  
    * Show address only to confirmed guests  
    * Reveal address 24 hours before event  
  * **Ticket Pricing:** A primary selector with four options: "Fixed Price," "Choose Your Price," "Donation-Based," "Free RSVP."  
    * Conditional fields appear based on the selection:  
      * If "Fixed Price," a `Ticket Price` input is displayed.  
      * If "Choose Your Price," `Minimum Price` and `Suggested Price` inputs are displayed.  
      * If "Donation Based," a `Suggested Donation` input is displayed.  
	-- Note: Free RSVP and Donation-Based events will support "Going", "Maybe", and "Not Going" responses, allowing hosts to gauge interest beyond confirmed attendance.
  * **Max Capacity:** An optional numerical input field to limit total attendance.  
  * **Guest List Visibility:** A radio button selector with three options:
    * **üåê Public** - Everyone can see who's attending
      * Helper text: "Create FOMO - Let everyone see who's going"
      * This is the default selection
    * **üéüÔ∏è Attendees (Live)** - Only ticket holders can see, starting when event begins
      * Helper text: "Exclusive - Attendees see count before event, full list during/after"  
    * **üîí Private** - Only you and co-hosts can see
      * Helper text: "Maximum privacy - No one else sees the guest list"
    * **Backend Logic:** 
      * Public: Sets `guest_list_visibility: "public"`
      * Attendees (Live): Sets `guest_list_visibility: "attendees_live"`
      * Private: Sets `guest_list_visibility: "private"`
  * **Event Privacy:** A single checkbox control.
    * **Label:** `[ ] Private Event - Invite Only`
    * **Default State:** Unchecked.
    * **Logic:** When unchecked (default), the event is public and anyone with the link can purchase tickets/RSVP. When checked, sends `is_invite_only: true` to the API, restricting ticket purchases to only those who have been explicitly invited by the host.
* **Action:** Tapping the **[Publish Event]** button triggers a Logic Gate:  
  * If the event is paid AND the user has no `hyperwallet_user_token`, the app displays `Screen 20: Hyperwallet Onboarding Modal`. Upon completion, it navigates to `Screen 7: Dynamic Event Management Screen`.  
  * Otherwise, it navigates directly to `Screen 7: Dynamic Event Management Screen`.

      * If "public": Always visible for upcoming/live/past events
      * If "attendees_live": Always visible for upcoming/live/past events (collaborators have same access as public mode)

### **Part 4: Pop-ups & Modals**

**Screen 20: Hyperwallet Onboarding Modal**

* **Purpose:** To securely host the one-time Hyperwallet payout setup process within a modal window. This is a critical step in the "Just-in-Time Friction" principle, ensuring a user only provides sensitive financial information at the exact moment it's required to receive payment.
* **Core Logic:** The Micasa backend will determine if a user needs to be onboarded by checking for the existence of a hyperwallet_user_token on their user record. The client application (both web and mobile) is responsible for calling the POST /api/users/me/payout-account/onboarding-token endpoint immediately before displaying the modal to fetch the single-use token required to render the embedded form.
* **Exhaustive List of Triggers:** The Hyperwallet Onboarding Modal is displayed automatically and conditionally in the following specific scenarios. It is only ever shown if the user has not completed this process before (i.e., their hyperwallet_user_token is null).
  * **For Hosts (Mobile App):** The modal is triggered immediately after a host taps [Publish Event] on Screen 6: Event Creation (Step 2) IF the event has a paid component (Fixed Price, Choose Your Price, or Donation Based).
    * User Flow: Screen 6 -> [Publish Event] -> Screen 20: Hyperwallet Modal -> Screen 7: Dynamic Event Management Screen.
  * **For Invited Collaborators (Web):** The modal is triggered immediately after an invited user taps [Accept Proposal] on the Screen W-3: Proposal Acceptance Page IF the proposal's profit share percentage is greater than 0%.
    * User Flow: Screen W-3 -> [Accept Proposal] -> Screen W-6 / 20: Hyperwallet Modal -> Screen W-5: App Funnel Page.
  * **For Collaborators Accepting Gigs (Mobile App):** The modal is triggered immediately after a user taps [Accept] on a paid gig proposal within the "Pending" tab of the "My Events" Hub (Screen 12).
    * User Flow: Screen 12 -> [Accept] -> Screen 20: Hyperwallet Modal -> Returns to Screen 12 with the gig moved to "Upcoming".

**Screen 21: Payout Dispute Modal**
* **Purpose:** To allow a collaborator to formally dispute a payout removal request.
* **Trigger:** Tapped from the `[Dispute Removal]` button on a gig card in the "My Events" Hub (Screen 12).
* **Content:** A text field for the collaborator to provide comments explaining their reason for the dispute. A main `[Submit Dispute]` button.
* **Action:** Tapping `[Submit Dispute]` sends the dispute to Micasa staff for manual review and changes the gig's status to `disputed`. All payouts for the event remain frozen until the dispute is resolved.

**Screen 22: Profile Completion Prompt Modal (Conditional Logic)**

* **Purpose:** To strongly encourage a user to complete their profile with essential information at the moment of highest relevance, thereby improving their standing in the community and the overall quality of the platform's social graph.
* **Core Logic:** This modal is displayed one time only. It triggers the very first time a user with an "incomplete" profile attempts one of the key actions listed below.
* **Definition of Incomplete:** A user's profile is considered "incomplete" if their profile_picture_url OR bio field is null or empty. The instagram_handle and personal_website_url fields do not affect this logic.

* **Trigger Model 1: Pre-Action ("Informed Continuance")**
  * This model is used when a strong first impression is critical to the success of the action itself.
  * **Applies To:**
    * **Applicants:** When a user taps [Apply] on an Open Position.
    * **Hosts:** When a user taps [Publish Event] on Screen 6: Event Creation (Step 2).
  * **Behavior:** The modal appears before the action is processed, momentarily pausing the flow.
  * **Content:**
    * Headline: "Help Them Get to Know You"
    * Body Text: "A complete profile with a photo and bio makes a great first impression. We highly recommend adding these before you continue."
    * Primary Button: [Complete My Profile]
    * Secondary Button: [Continue]
  * **Actions:**
    * Tapping [Complete My Profile] navigates the user to the Edit Profile Screen (Screen 16). After saving, they are returned to their original context.
    * Tapping [Continue] immediately dismisses the modal and proceeds with the user's original action.

* **Trigger Model 2: Post-Action ("Helpful Suggestion")**
  * This model is used when securing the user's action without friction is the top priority.
  * **Applies To:**
    * **Invited Collaborators:** When a user taps [Accept] on a pending proposal in the "My Events" Hub (Screen 12).
  * **Behavior:** The primary action (accepting the gig) is sent to the backend and confirmed first. The modal appears after the action is successful.
  * **Content:**
    * Headline: "You're on the team!"
    * Body Text: "To make sure you look great on the public event page, we suggest adding a photo and bio to your profile."
    * Primary Button: [Complete My Profile]
    * Secondary Button: [Maybe Later]
  * **Actions:**
    * Tapping [Complete My Profile] navigates the user to the Edit Profile Screen (Screen 16).
    * Tapping [Maybe Later] dismisses the modal.

**Screen 23: Cancel Event Confirmation Modal**

* **Purpose:** To prevent a host from accidentally canceling their event and to ensure they understand the consequences of this irreversible action.
* **Trigger:** Tapping the [Cancel Event] button on the Dynamic Event Management Screen (Screen 7).
* **Content:**
  * Headline: "Are you sure you want to cancel?"
  * Body Text: "This action cannot be undone. All registered guests will be notified via email that the event has been canceled, and any payments will be refunded. Are you sure you wish to proceed?"
  * Primary (Destructive) Button: [Yes, Cancel Event]
  * Secondary (Safe) Button: [Nevermind]
* **Actions:**
  * Tapping [Yes, Cancel Event] executes the API call to cancel the event and then navigates the user back to their Dashboard (Screen 4).
  * Tapping [Nevermind] closes the modal, leaving the user on the Dynamic Event Management Screen (Screen 7).

**Screen 24: Message Guest List Modal (Simple UI)**

* **Purpose:** To provide a simple, unified interface for the host to compose and send a broadcast message to all registered guests.
* **Trigger:** Tapping the [Message Guest List] button on the Dynamic Event Management Screen (Screen 7).
* **Backend Logic:**
  * The message is sent via SMS to all guests who have a phone_number on their profile.
  * The message is sent via email to any guests who do not have a phone number.
  * For all messages sent via email, the system will auto-generate the subject line using the format: "A message from the host of [Event Title]".
* **Content (Static UI):** The modal will always display the same simple interface.
  * Headline: "Message All Guests"
  * Info Text: 
    * For paid/donation events: "This will be sent via SMS to guests with a phone number and via email to all others."
    * For Free RSVP events: Shows checkboxes: "Send to: [‚úì] All confirmed guests [‚úì] Include maybes"
  * Input Field: A multi-line text area labeled "Message".
  * Primary Button: [Send Message]
  * Secondary Button: [Cancel]
* **Actions:**
  * Tapping [Send Message] validates that the message field is not empty, triggers the POST /api/events/:id/broadcast endpoint, shows a confirmation toast ("Message Sent!"), and closes the modal.
  * Tapping [Cancel] closes the modal without sending a message.

**Screen 25: Mandatory Profile Initialization Gate**

* **Purpose**: To act as a mandatory gate for any user who has not yet set a unique username or provided a phone number, ensuring all active mobile app users have the necessary data to participate fully in the Micasa community.
* **Trigger**: This screen will appear as a blocking modal immediately after app launch (over the Dashboard) on **every session** if any of the following conditions are met for the logged-in user:
   * `user.phone_number` IS NULL
   * OR `user.username` IS NULL
   * OR `user.is_username_autogenerated` IS TRUE
* **Behavior**: This is **not an optional or dismissible modal**. The user cannot access the rest of the app until they complete this step.
* **Content**:
   * **Headline**: "Welcome to the Community!"
   * **Body Text**: "Let's get your profile ready. What should we call you, and how can we reach you?"
   * **Input Field 1**: "Username" (pre-filled with their current username if exists, empty if null).
   * **Input Field 2**: "Phone Number" (pre-filled if exists, empty if null).
   * **Primary Button**: `[Complete Setup]`
* **Action**:
   * Both fields are mandatory. The button is disabled until both are filled.
   * Tapping `[Complete Setup]` will call the `PUT /api/users/me` endpoint to update their profile. On success, the modal is dismissed and the user can interact with the app. On failure (e.g., username taken), an error message is displayed.

### **Part 5: Post-Event Experience Screens**
