# Micasa Relaunch MVP - Scope of Work (SOW)
**Document Version: 8.0**
**Status: Current with Latest Screen List Updates**
**Last Updated: December 2024**

## 1. Executive Summary & Guiding Principles

This document outlines the complete scope of work for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) relaunch of the Micasa platform. The objective is to launch a lean, stable, and strategically-focused product that validates our core "steel thread": enabling creators to easily collaborate on events and share revenue transparently.

The development will be guided by these key principles:
* **The "Steel Thread"**: A relentless focus on the core user journey of creating, collaborating on, and monetizing events
* **Just-in-Time Friction**: User friction (e.g., account creation, profile completion, payout onboarding) is deferred until the moment of highest user intent
* **Creator Empowerment**: The platform provides maximum flexibility and control to the host, particularly through robust event creation controls
* **Hybrid Web/App Model**: The guest experience is web-first for frictionless sharing, while creator tools are housed in the mobile app
* **Dynamic Social Graph**: The platform transforms static contact lists into living records of shared event experiences, facilitating post-event networking and community building
* **Progressive Profile Completion**: A tiered system ensures users provide necessary information at contextually appropriate moments
* **Collaborative Attribution**: The platform tracks and celebrates the full creative team's contributions, both financial and social
* **Transparent Team Economics**: All team members can see the full profit share breakdown, promoting trust and fairness

## 2. Web Platform Scope (events.micasa.events)

The web platform is designed for the guest experience and the frictionless onboarding of new collaborators. It must be fast, responsive, and transactional.

### Part 2.1: Guest Experience
* **Screen W-1: Public Event Page**: Display all public information for events with:
  * **Event Team Display**: Shows complete creative team (Host, Co-hosts, Collaborators) with profile pictures, names, and role badges
  * **"Who's Going" Attendee Display**: Dynamic visibility based on three-tier system:
    * **Public**: Always visible to everyone ("Jane, John, and 23 others are going")
    * **Attendees Live**: Hidden to non-attendees; shows count pre-event, full display during/after for attendees
    * **Private**: Hidden to all except hosts and co-hosts
  * **Invitation Context Recognition**: 
    * Detect and preserve invitation_id URL parameter
    * Display personalized invitation banner with host attribution
    * Track invitation-to-purchase conversion separately from general referrals
    * Maintain full parameter chain: `?invitation_id={id}&ref={inviter_user_id}`
  * Referral parameter capture (?ref=[user_id]) for attribution tracking
  * Open positions section with role titles and dynamic button states
* **Screen W-2: Conditional Checkout & RSVP Flow**: Handle guest actions based on event pricing model:
  * Flow A: Direct payment for fixed price or choose-your-price events
  * Flow B: RSVP first with optional donation for donation-based events
  * Confirmation messages acknowledge referral sources when applicable
  * **Enhanced confirmation messages based on guest list visibility:**
    * If arrived via referral: "Thanks to [Referrer Name] for sharing this event! ðŸŽ‰"
    * If "attendees_live" pre-event: "You're in! The guest list will unlock when the event begins."
    * If "attendees_live" during/post: "You're in! Check out who else is attending!"

  * **"Past Events" Section**: Shows history of public events where user was host/collaborator/attendee (privacy-controlled)

  * Step 1: Account creation (social or email)
  * Step 2: Username selection and phone verification (OTP)

## 5. Business Logic & Rules

### Event Management

  * Financial details locked after first sale
  * Major changes trigger notifications
  * Co-hosts cannot edit core event details
* **Cancellation**: 
  * Available anytime before event ends (hosts only)
  * Automatic refunds processed
#### Guest List Visibility Tiers
* **Public**: Always visible to everyone (default for FOMO).
* **Attendees Live**:
    * Non-attendees: Cannot see any guest information.
    * Attendees pre-event: See count only.
    * Attendees during/after: See full guest list.
    * **Team Members (Hosts, Co-hosts, Collaborators): Always see the full list, bypassing all restrictions.**
* **Private**: Only hosts and co-hosts can access.
* **Post-Event Access**: All participants maintain permanent access to event summaries

* **Free RSVP Events**: Support Going/Maybe/Not Going responses with separate tracking

### Collaboration Rules
* **Role Hierarchy**:
  * **Host**: Full control over event and team
  * **Co-host**: Can invite guests, manage team, check in attendees, view full financials
  * **Team Member**: Focus on their role, limited financial visibility
* **Profit Share**: 
  * Set at invitation, locked after acceptance
  * **Full transparency**: All team members see everyone's percentages
* **Attribution**: 
  * All team members automatically receive unique referral links
  * Promotional impact tracked and celebrated post-event
  * UI hints guide users to share with tracking
* **Removal Process**:
  * Host-initiated only (pre or post-event)
  * 24-hour response window for collaborator
  * Auto-approval if no response
  * Disputes freeze all event payouts
* **Open Position Management**:
  * Cannot delete positions with active applications
  * Positions marked "filled" when accepted
  * Role titles limited to 30 characters
* **Application Management**:
  * One application per user per position enforced at database level
  * Application withdrawal allowed until position is filled
  * Automatic notification to host on withdrawal
* **Proposal Visibility**:
  * Full transparency of profit shares to all team members
  * Host messages preserved and displayed in proposal flow
  * Co-host privileges clearly communicated during invitation

### Financial Rules
* **Platform Fee**: Flat fee per ticket/donation (amount TBD)
* **Stripe Fees**: Absorbed from gross revenue
* **Settlement**: Host-triggered after event completion
* **Transparency**:
    * **Profit Shares**: All team members can see the profit share *percentages* of everyone on the team to ensure fairness.
    * **Payout Amounts**: Final payout *amounts* are visible based on role. Hosts/Co-hosts can see the full financial breakdown and all payout amounts. Collaborators can only see their own individual payout amount.
* **Payout Prerequisites**:
  * All collaborators must have Hyperwallet accounts
  * No pending removal requests or disputes
  * Sufficient Stripe balance available

#### Profile Completion Requirements

To support both frictionless guest conversion and robust creator profiles, the platform will use a tiered, just-in-time approach based on the user's entry point (Web vs. Mobile App).

**1. Web Onboarding (Minimal Friction for Guests & Applicants)**
* A user can become a guest or apply for a position on the web by creating a minimal account (Social OAuth or Email/Password). For these initial actions, a phone number is **not** mandatory. Profile completion is encouraged via non-blocking nudges.

**2. Mobile App Onboarding (Mandatory Gate)**
* The mobile app is the primary tool for active creators. To ensure a high-quality experience and data integrity, a stricter rule applies.
* The **Mandatory Profile Initialization Gate (Screen 25)** will be displayed immediately after login on **every session** if the user's profile is incomplete (`phone_number` is null OR `is_username_autogenerated` is true).
* The user will be required to provide a unique username and a phone number before they can access any other part of the mobile app.

**3. Payout Onboarding (Just-in-Time)**
* Separately, any user performing an action that requires them to receive payment for the first time (e.g., publishing a paid event, accepting a paid proposal) will trigger the **Hyperwallet Onboarding Modal (Screen 20)** if they do not have a `hyperwallet_user_token`. This is triggered after the primary action is initiated but before it is finalized.

* **Privacy Controls**:
  * Users control visibility of "Upcoming Events" section
  * Users control visibility of "Past Events" section
  * Granular controls for past events (hosted/collaborated/attended)
  * Separate controls for financial vs. social information
  *Users toggle these controls from the edit profile page.

## 6. Communication Strategy

### Channel Allocation
* **SMS**: Host/co-host initiated invitations with referral tracking, urgent notifications
* **Email**: Purchase confirmations, system notifications, broadcast messages, post-event summaries
* **Push**: Real-time updates for active app users, post-event celebrations, referral milestones

### Notification Triggers
